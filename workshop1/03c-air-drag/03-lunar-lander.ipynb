    "\n",
    "1. In GlowScript, click the link to \"View this program\" to see the code used for the Lunar Lander game. What are the four line numbers that have the four update equations that:\n",
    "  1. calculate net force\n",
    "  2. update velocity\n",
    "  3. update position\n",
    "  4. update time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Besides the gravitational force by the Moon on the lander, what other force acts on the lander?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A real rocket loses mass due to burning fuel. [Here's the same game](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/Aaron_Titus/folder/picup/program/lunar-lander-burn-fuel-with-graphs), but with the loss of mass included in the model. Why does the y-acceleration of the rocket increase when the vertical thruster is firing? (After all, it's constant when the lander is in free-fall.)"
